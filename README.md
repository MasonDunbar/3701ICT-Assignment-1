### Milestone 1: Main Page
#### Objective
For the first milestone of the "My Todo List" application project in React Native, the task is to develop and display the main page of the application. This initial page is a basic page, which sets up the foundation for the app's UI and functionality.

    Emulator Testing: The app must be tested on either an Android or iPhone emulator.
    Customization: The app must employ a color scheme and specific styling, to make the interface visually appealing for the users.
    
### Milestone 2: Enhancing Functionality & Navigation
#### Objective
Milestone 2 aims to elevate the user experience and streamline navigation within the "My Todo List" application. This phase encompasses the refinement of button designs, integration of a new interface, and the establishment of transitions between screens through the utilization of React Native's stack navigation.

1. Customized "Add New Todo" Button: Update the appearance of the "Add New Todo" button, created in the first milestone by incorporating an icon. 
2. Navigation to "Add New Todo" Screen: Incorporate stack navigation functionality to transition from the home screen to the New Item screen through interaction with the customized "Add New Todo" button.
3. Add New Item Screen: Create a new screen with two input fields and two buttons: 
•	The Title, which will be used to describe the new to-do item.
•	The Description field, which supports multiline input and allows the user to add more details to the task. 
•	The Cancel button, which redirects the user back to the home screen and cancels creating a new item.
