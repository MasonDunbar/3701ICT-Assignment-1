### Milestone 1: Main Page
#### Objective

For the first milestone of the "My Todo List" application project in React Native, the task is to develop and display the main page of the application. This initial page is a basic page, which sets up the foundation for the app's UI and functionality.

#### Requirements

    1. Title: The application must display the title "My Todo List" at the top of the main page.
    2. Todo List: A list of to-dos in the central part of the screen is the main feature.
    3. Add New Todo Button: The application must include an "Add New Todo" button at the bottom of the screen.

#### Design Considerations

    Emulator Testing: The app must be tested on either an Android or iPhone emulator.

    Customization: The app must employ a color scheme and specific styling, to make the interface visually appealing for the users.
